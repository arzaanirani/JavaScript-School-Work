This web application allows a user to display the lyrics of song (with embedded chords) in a canvas environment. The song lyrics will be formatted with the chords above lyrics in the song. After, the user manipulates each word by clicking and dragging it. The updated word and chord positions can then be saved to the same or a different text file. Songs may only be called from files that are in the '/songs' directory.
