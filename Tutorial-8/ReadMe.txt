I've supplied an optional alternate version of the tutorial for those who might want to experiment
with setting up a native compile environment for building native npm modules
using the node-gyp npm utility.

I am showing what I did to set up my machine. Your mileage may vary. If you have useful suggestions
based on your own experience please email them to me so I can post them for others.
